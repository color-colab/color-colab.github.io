The Fayum Portraits, for example, are a remarkable trove of naturalistic paintings from the imperial Roman province of Egypt, which are among the few paintings on wood that survive from that period. These near-life-size portraits, which were painted on funerary objects, present their subjects with an array of skin tones, from olive green to deep brown, testifying to a complex intermingling of Greek, Roman, and local Egyptian populations.<br></p>

                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The scrubbing away of pigments — and in general the omission of ancient polychromy in the general public’s awareness —  has had social and political consequences outside of the art world. This includes the misled idea of a ‘unique’ Greco-Roman predilection for pure whiteness. While this predilection has now been disproven, the idea of a Western difference with other civilizations around their relationship to color remains. Occasionally fueled by racist views, the idea has been that vivid colors are avoided by people and cultures “of refinement”, and that instead “savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great predilection for vivid colors” (Goethe). It is not surprising, then, that “white pureness” has (in the mainstream mind) defined classical sculptural work —and later been immortalized in Renaissance pieces emulating the classical style. Currently, in the global north the idea of a Greco-Roman refinement surrounding white purity has been used for a search of identity, including by some white supremacist and fascist groups.<br></p>

Europe in the 21st century is undergoing an identity crisis, related to notions of belonging, loss of heritage, immigration, cultural intermixing, and economic and political instability. A rise in neo-fascism is entangled with fear of difference, immigration and racism. This situation not only allows for, but requires a re-examination of identity as connected to cultural heritage. Between April of 2017 and November of 2018, a sleuth of articles ‘revealing’ classical polychromy to the general public appeared in major newspapers, both in print and electronic form. Until then, according to some, many Westerners had been engaged in an “act of collective blindness”. The re-discovery of classical polychromy in the mainstream media has opened up a conversation around questions of cultural heritage, its appropriation, and the role of artifacts in explaining the past as well as the present. In the current socio-political state of what was once a multi-ethnic Roman Empire, developing tools to attempt to answer these questions is critical.<br></p>
